# Sound-design

## About this project

This repository is a personal sound design sandbox.
I use it to practice creating music and sound effects for video games using **LMMS** (Linux MultiMedia Studio).

All sounds and compositions here are original creations made for learning purposes, experimentation, and portfolio building.

Feel free to explore, get inspired, and check the license before using anything.
